# What on Earth is this?

Hockey attendence is managed in BenchApp.

BenchApp outputs ical files Google can subscribe to.

I like being at the game 30 minutes before it starts, and it takes me 30 minutes to get to most games - so this script scrapes the ics from BenchApp, adds a "Drive" and "Dress" event and hosts it on a GitHub page so I can subscribe to them on Google Calendar.

Long story short, I was tired of doing math when looking at my calendar and so I created an overly complicated cron+hosting script using GitHub Actions and Pages
